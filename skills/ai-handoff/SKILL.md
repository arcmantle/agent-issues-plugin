description: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent to pick up, anchored to the active agent-issues records.
argument-hint: What will the next session be used for?
---

Follow the shared [language standard](../agent-issues-language.md).
Follow the shared [skill operating contract](../agent-issues-operating-contract.md).

Write a handoff that lets a new agent continue the work without rebuilding the state from scratch. Do not create a file, including a temp file or a workspace artifact.
Use the [Handoff recipe](../recipes/handoff.md) for the tracked handoff body.

The handoff must include:

- The tracked entity IDs, titles, and statuses that define the current scope.
- The relevant blockers from `blocks` relations.
- The relevant user stories or ADR constraints linked to the active issue.
- The files or artifacts to read next, given by path instead of copied text.
- A `suggested skills` section for the next agent.

Do not copy content that already exists in a PRD, an ADR, a plan, an issue, a commit, or a diff. Reference it by path or ID instead.

Remove sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or personal data.

If the user gave arguments, treat them as a description of the next session's focus. Shape the handoff to match.

## Save the handoff in the tracker

Once you write the handoff body, save it in `agent-issues` so the next agent can retrieve it. Do not stop at returning text in your response.

Run the **Handoff Write** recipe to create a handoff with direct title and body text, then link it with `handsOff` to the active issue, PRD, ADR, or initiative. The returned handoff reference is the continuation target.

After you save the handoff, return this continuation prompt in a code block, with the returned handoff ID (for example, `HO7`):

```text
Continue from handoff <handoffId>.
```

To fix a saved handoff, run the **Entity Create And Edit** recipe to update its title or body.

If you need more text beyond the saved handoff, put it in your response only.
